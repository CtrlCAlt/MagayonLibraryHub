The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don\'t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you\'ll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.\r\n\r\nClear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.\r\n\r\nLearn how to:\r\n- Make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy);\r\n- Overcome a lack of motivation and willpower;\r\n- Design your environment to make success easier;\r\n- Get back on track when you fall off course;\r\n...and much more.\r\n\r\nAtomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.', 'uploads/679f3d14e8f99_atomic habits.jpg', '2025-02-02 09:38:28', '2025-02-09 06:29:08', 'Available'),

After years of covering war, wildfires, pandemic, and mass shootings, Fuller was captivated by the story of this group of high school boys. It was uplifting. During the gloom of the pandemic, it was a happy story. It was a sports story but not an ordinary one, built on the chemistry between a group of underestimated boys and their superhero advocate coach, Keith Adams, a deaf former athlete himself. The team, and Adams, tackled the many stereotypes and seemed to be succeeding.

Most people avoid him, but to Birdie, he represents everything she’s ever longed for. She finds herself falling for Arthur and the land he knows so well. \r\n\r\nAgainst the warnings of those who care about them, Birdie and Emaleen move to his isolated cabin in the mountains, on the far side of the Wolverine River.\r\n\r\nIt’s just the three of them in the vast black woods, far from roads, telephones, electricity, and outside contact, but Birdie believes she has come prepared. At first, it’s idyllic and she can picture a happily ever after: Together they catch salmon, pick berries, and climb mountains so tall it’s as if they could touch the bright blue sky. But soon Birdie discovers that Arthur is something much more mysterious and dangerous than she could have ever imagined, and that like the Alaska wilderness, a fairy tale can be as dark as it is beautiful.\r\n\r\nBlack Woods, Blue Sky is a novel with life-and-death stakes, about the love between a mother and daughter, and the allure of a wild life—about what we gain and what it might cost us.', 'uploads/67a5926329b45_81czYKpm-cL._SY466_.jpg', '2025-02-07 04:56:03', '2025-02-10 09:51:25', 'Available'),

Lindio-McGovern presents theoretical and ethnographic insights from observational and interview data gathered during fieldwork in various global cities—Hong Kong, Taipei, Rome, Vancouver, Chicago and Metro-Manila.
